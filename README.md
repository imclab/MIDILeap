MIDILeap
========

Links up an Arduino MIDI controller with a Leap Motion and NodeJS. The .c file is the Arduino code (install this to your Arduino).

Huge thank you to Andrew Fisher (@ajfisher) for his help with this one! Couldn't have done it without his incredible wisdom.

If you make something brilliantly genius with this that saves lives through song and dance, please do let me know! I'm on Twitter at @thatpatrickguy, or you can find me at http://www.patrickcatanzariti.com.

Best of luck,

PatCat
